A really stupid idea on how to store your passwords without ever storing them

## The idea?
The idea of the project is to get a password manager that never stores a password. Instead the user needs to remember a simpler password and a number (and which site/service it is used for).

The script then uses the input to create a 20 char long pseudo random password that can be used for the site/service.

The script will probably generate the same password on more than one set of input. But hopefully this will happen less as the algorithm changes.

I do not claim that this is a safe way to manage passwords, it's more of a fun project.
